### ME292B Individual Project: Planning
This is the base repository for starting an individual project. Please use this repository as the template and begin your project. You can follow these steps:
- Click the green button in the upper right corner labeled 'Use this template' to create your own repository. 
- Set the repository's owner as the organizer, 'BerkeleyME292B'. 
- Name your repository as **YourNameStudentID** like **yixiao123456**. 
- Set your individual repository as private to prevent others from viewing your code and commits. 


Please be aware that Dr. Zhan and the teaching assistants have access to all commits. You also have the option to push only your final version once, and this will be the version that we will use for grading.


Note that the files in **./commonroad-search-master/tutorials** and **./commonroad-search-master/scenarios** should be downloaded from the [Search-based Motion Planner with Motion Primitives](https://link-url-here.orghttps://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-search). The output solution files should be stored in the folder **./solutions**. The report, diagnosis_log.md and README.md to reproduce your solutions should be stored in the folder **./reports**.
