Simulation of Path Planning Algorithms in real transportation senarios.

Go to the folder: Commonroad-search-master/SMP, then go to subfolder: batch_processing, open the file: batch_processing_astar_dynamicweight.ipynb Then just run the code, and you can reproduce my solutions: solve 378 in 500 scenarios with astar_dynamic-weight algorithms.
